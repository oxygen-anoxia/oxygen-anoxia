📌 GitHub Profile README — Updated Version (Recommend-Agent moved forward)
Hi, I’m Yiming Wang (oxygen-anoxia)

I build intelligent systems, full-stack web applications, and LLM-powered tools.
My work spans AI engineering, multi-component system design, and practical automation for real-world use cases.

⭐ Featured Projects (Most Relevant & Technically Mature)

These represent the strongest and most complete examples of my CS and engineering work.

1. virtualstream — Multi-Module Virtual Streamer System

A virtual streaming framework combining real-time audio processing, LLM-driven logic, and interactive modules.

Tech: Python, audio pipelines, LLM integration
My contributions:

Implemented core components (ASR → LLM pipeline, VC integration, interaction logic)

Designed integration code and backend modules

Reconstructed and documented the repository from early offline collaboration

Note:
Initial development was done via local file merging, so historical commit logs were not preserved.
This repo documents the actual modules I developed.

📌 A complex engineering system demonstrating multi-module coordination and real collaboration.

2. soda-frontend & soda-backend — Full-Stack Social Platform

A web-based social platform built collaboratively, featuring interactive user functions and a stable backend API layer.

Tech: Vue, Python backend, RESTful API
My contributions:

Implemented backend logic, API endpoints, and DB support

Developed frontend features and UI interactions

Designed part of the service architecture and routing logic

📌 Shows full-stack engineering ability and practical system implementation.

3. youtube_toolGit — YouTube Content Toolkit

A practical utility toolbox for automated summarization of YouTube content.

Tech: Python, LLM summarization logic
Features:

Batch summarization pipeline

Flexible automation scripts

Internal tool designed for real personal workflow

📌 Demonstrates automation, scripting proficiency, and applied LLM usage.

4. recommend-Agent — AI Recommendation Engine for Academic Pathways

A recommendation engine developed under mentorship from a doctoral researcher.

Tech: Python, LLM/RAG logic, backend-style pipelines
My contributions:

Implemented core recommendation logic and decision flow

Built preprocessing, ranking, and retrieval components

Designed preliminary evaluation pipeline

📌 A research-aligned project showcasing reasoning systems and structured AI workflows.

📁 Secondary / In-Progress Projects
project_frontend — LLM Application Frontend (Work in Progress)

A self-designed frontend interface for LLM applications.
Currently under active iteration and UI/UX redesign.
